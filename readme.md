# LearnRust

This repo is just a collection of small Rust projects, as I learn Rust.

`my_first_rust_project` is the notes I took following along with "Learn Rust is 2 Hours" video by The Cyber Mentor.
So are `challenge_one` and `challenge_two`.

The other projects are just projects I thought of that could help push me to learn more Rust.
